## ðŸ“Š Experience in Data Science & MLOPs

I have worked on several projects that demonstrate my skills in data science and MLOps:
- **[Credit Approval with Classification Algorithm: Best Practices in Data Science & MLOps](https://github.com/ju4nv1e1r4/credit-approval):** This project aims to develop a predictive system to assist in credit assessment. Using Machine Learning algorithms, with the aim of building a classification model to determine whether or not to approve credit for specific customers. This project can help make faster and more assertive decisions, reducing the risk of default and optimizing credit allocation.
- **[Life Cycle Management of Machine Learning Models with MLflow](https://github.com/ju4nv1e1r4/mlflow-2024):** Demonstration of the use of MLflow as a tool in Machine Learning projects, and deployment with kubernetes.
- **[Latency Improvements in ML Model Inference](https://github.com/ju4nv1e1r4/inference-speed-test):** This repository is about model serving experiments in different languages. Think of Python as the industry, it manufactures the model, but it doesn't serve it so well in APIs, software and systems. The challenge here is to find the best implementation to serve Machine Learning models, aiming to reduce latency.
